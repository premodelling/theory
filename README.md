## Reading Material

* [The Research Methods Knowledge Base](https://conjointly.com/kb/), William M. K. Trochim<br><i>This is an excellent introduction to research methods, and parts of the book are mandatory reading in preparation for week 2 and we will quiz you on the material. You will note that the book introduces methods from a social science background but the concepts apply to empirical research in any discipline. As you read through the basics, try to think about examples in your own field to relate the concepts to something concrete (e.g., try and relate concepts to a previous project you have carried out, or just make up examples).</i>

* [Researching Information Systems and Computing](https://modules.lancaster.ac.uk/mod/url/view.php?id=1728978), Briony J. Oates, 2006/2021, SAGE Publications/...<br><i>This book provides a lightweight introduction and overview of research methods. It is very accessible and presents research methods in the context of research in information systems, software engineering and computer science. The book is not mandatory.</i>
